In this project we will be developing a movie recommending ML algorithm, many a times
people want to watch out movies that suits their area of interest but fails to find such, to
tackle this problem this recommendation system will recommend movies that will suit them
by recognizing patterns in their viewing.

## Vision Statement:

## Objectives:

To successfully develop an ML model that can be trained and utilized on a production level to solve
the challenges effectively.
