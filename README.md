# G7-MovieRecommendation

## Introduction:

In this project we will be developing a movie recommending ML algorithm, many a times
people want to watch out movies that suits their area of interest but fails to find such, to
tackle this problem this recommendation system will recommend movies that will suit them
by recognizing patterns in their viewing.

## Vision Statement:

“Our vision is to improve people experience in watching their favorite shows and movies
without thinking much about the infinitely many options available.”

## Objectives:

To successfully develop an ML model that can be trained and utilized on a production level to solve
the challenges effectively.

## Strategies and Initiatives:

In this project we will be developing a movie recommending ML recommendation system.
What is a recommender system?\
A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant
information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset.\
There are 3 types of recommendation system:
1. content based
2. popularity based
3. collaborative based\
In this project we will be using hybrid model of content and popularity based system.

## Risks and Challenges:

User satisfaction: The system should receive positive feedback and high satisfaction ratings
from users.\
Scalability: The system should be able to handle large volumes of data and users without
compromising performance or accuracy.\
Flexibility: The system should be flexible and adaptable to changing user needs,
preferences, and behaviors.
